Checking domain availability sounds simple - but many people run into false positives and slow lookups. Here's a smart, fast, and reliable workflow.

## Use multiple checks (but keep it lightweight)

- Start with a registrar results page (e.g., Namecheap results). It's fast and shows alternates.
- Verify via a second source if it's a high-value name.
- Avoid heavy API calls on every search to keep costs near zero.

## Avoid common pitfalls

- Some tools cache stale results - refresh and recheck.

## A quick reliability checklist

- Search with two reputable sources before acting.
- Check the exact TLD you intend to buy (e.g., .com vs .io).
- If the name is valuable, verify again in an incognito or different network.
- Move quickly once confirmed: add to cart, then decide on DNS later.

- Keep the exact TLD in mind (.com vs .co vs .io often differs).
- Don't forget internationalized domains (IDN) rules if relevant.

## Move quickly when a name is available

- Add to cart immediately if the name is desirable.
- Register on a reliable, transparent registrar.
- Point DNS later; securing the name comes first.

## Try long-tail domain variations

If the exact match is taken, test long-tail, intent-rich alternatives:

- add geo terms (city, state)
- add niche descriptors ("guide", "app", "tools")
- keep it pronounceable and short
