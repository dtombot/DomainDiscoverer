Brandable domains trade exact keywords for memorability and vibe. Here's how to pick winners.

## Principles of strong brandables

- Short and pronounceable.
- No confusing hyphens or numbers.
- Pass the radio test; easy to spell on first hearing.

## Brainstorming techniques

- Blend two simple words (e.g., "Pixel" + "Nest").
- Use light affixes ("ly", "io", "hub") sparingly.
- Prioritize .com when possible.
